🎮 Operation Modes
The robot operates in three modes controlled by dip switches:

Mode 0: Autonomous Navigation
Robot starts at position (15, 0) facing North

Uses flood-fill algorithm to navigate to goal (7, 7)

Continuously updates maze map based on sensor readings

Mode 1: Pre-programmed Path
Follows predetermined path to goal

Useful for testing and calibration

Mode 2: Manual Wall Following
Implements wall-following algorithm

Makes decisions based on sensor inputs:

Right-hand rule preference

Obstacle avoidance

Dead-end handling

📊 Maze Configuration
Size: Configurable up to 20×20 cells (default 16×16)

Goal Area: 2×2 center cells (default rows 7-8, cols 7-8)

Wall Detection: Uses IR sensors to detect and map walls

Distance Calculation: Flood-fill algorithm computes shortest paths

🔄 Movement System
Motor Control
PWM-based speed control (100-200 range)

Encoder feedback for precise distance measurement

PID-like adjustment for straight-line movement

Turning Mechanisms
90° Left/Right Turns: Timed motor control

180° Turn: Combined turn operation

Orientation Tracking: Maintains current facing direction
